This Repository is self explanitory. I'll document and complete all 150 leetcode problems here. I did a few to start but the problem set may be nice. 

6/12/2024: Edit: I have been doing the "Pareto Problem set" so alot of those questions will come first. The goal is to code every day in some form and build a big stupid library of problems I've been over to show my progress over time. The first few months this has been open, I slacked off a bit, but I will come here every so often to give whoever's keeping tabs on this repository (me lol) an update on my progress and how I'm feeling about what I'm practicing. 

Styling for this coming soon ;)
