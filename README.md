Not all of these solutions are 100% original, the purpose for this repository is to learn DSA in the contex of coding interviews and problems on leetcode. In alot of these solutions, I include mine and a more optimal or easier to understand approach if I struggled. (I struggle a bit) 

I have been doing the "Pareto Problem set" so alot of those questions will come first. The goal is to code every day in some form and build a big stupid library of problems I've been over to show my progress over time. The first few months this has been open, I slacked off a bit, but I will come here every so often to give whoever's keeping tabs on this repository (me lol) an update on my progress and how I'm feeling about what I'm practicing. 

Styling for this coming soon ;)
